My name is Inga, and I am a rising junior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. I am a hardware hacker curious about wearable devices, machine learning, and the future of human-computer interaction using brain-computer interfaces.

I was born and raised in Russia, but I moved to the United States right in the middle of high school. Having lived in a cradle of Russian cosmonautics, I've been visiting the mission control center, museums of space history, and pavilions with real-sized rockets since young age. This sparked my interest in engineering early on, and I keep fueling it by tinkering with electronics and engaging in [hardware/software projects](/projects).
